## Features

### Navbar
- Displays the user's total coins, starting at 0.
- Dynamically updates as coins are earned or spent.

### Banner Section
- Features a banner with a background, heading, and button.
- Clicking the button increases the user's coins, enabling them to buy players.

### Player Selection Section
- Contains toggle buttons to switch between:
  - **Available Players**: Displays all players available for selection.
  - **Selected Players**: Displays the number of selected players, initially 0.

#### Player Cards
- Each card displays:
  - Player Name
  - Country
  - Role
  - Batting/Bowling Style
  - Image
  - Bidding Price
- Includes a "Choose Player" button to select players.

### Selection Logic
1. Users can select a maximum of 6 players.
2. Duplicate player selection is not allowed.
3. Selection requires sufficient coins; an alert is shown if coins are insufficient.
4. Notifications (powered by **React-Toastify**) provide feedback for successful or invalid actions.

### Selected Players List
- Displays all selected players with details:
  - Player Name
  - Role
  - Image
  - Bidding Price
- Each card includes a "Remove" button to unselect players.
- Includes an **"Add More Players"** button to return to the player selection view.
